### [The VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2020 (VoxSRC-20)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/competition2020.html) 

 Track 4: Speaker Diarization

- [1st] [Microsoft Speaker Diarization System for the Voxceleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9413832)
  - Assuming the maximum number of simultaneously talking speakers is two, then using continuous speech separation (CSS) to separate the audio into two channels to remove the overlapped segments in a single channel.
  - Segmental Speaker Embedding Extraction for each single channel, speaker clustering for two channels together to give the diarization result from one system
  - Ensemble multiple diarization systems with different front-end / back-end components

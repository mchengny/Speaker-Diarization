### 2021

- [BW-EDA-EEND: streaming END-TO-END Neural Speaker Diarization for a Variable Number of Speakers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9414371)
  - BW-EDA-EEND (Block-Wise EDA + Transformer Encoder)
  - Block-level recurrence in the hidden states to carry information from block to block, making the algorithm complexity linear in time.
